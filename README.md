# odin-flex-practice: Getaway

A practice webpage from The Odin Project's foundation course. Titled "Odin Flex Practice", this webpage aims to utilize CSS flexbox to create the layout of a given design. Since only the layout design was given, it was up to me to fill the page with meaningful content. I chose to create the landing page for a fake company called Getaway. Getaway helps people locate the perfect spot to take a vacation and enjoy the beauty of nature.


## Here is the layout design given by The Odin Project :

## My implementation of the landing page for Getaway using this design:

***While implementing this landing page, responsive web browsing based off screen width was taken into consideration. Here is the same landing page seen at different screen widths.***
